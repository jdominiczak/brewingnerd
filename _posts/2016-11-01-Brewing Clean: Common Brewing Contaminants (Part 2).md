Brewing, in an overly simplistic sense, is the creation of growth media for the single celled organism of choice.  It just so happens that we have developed a taste for the resulting waste liquid.  Our goal as brewers is to control the living organisms that are present in our beer to only the ones we want.  Understanding what common contaminants are, where they come from, and what issues they present assist the brewer in developing a system that limits the probability of contamination and infection.

## Microbial contaminants
The microbial contaminants we cover here fall into three broad categories: yeasts, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria.  While it may be counterintuitive that yeast is included as a category, wild or unintended yeasts that make their way into the wort can affect the final product.  The same goes for bacteria.  Many styles of beer rely on bacteria to provide it's signature taste or mouthfeel.  While in these styles the aforementioned microbes are not contaminants, if they are unintentionally present in a beer it is considered a flaw.  

### Yeasts
The single celled eukaryotes known as yeasts are nearly omnipresent in the environment.  While the term yeast is often used to describe either brewing or baking yeast strains, there exist a plethora of non-brewing strains.  The Saccharomyces genus contains the top cropping (*S. cerevisiae*) and bottom cropping (*S. pastorianus*) strains of brewers yeast.  These yeast strains *ingest* sugar and *expel* ethanol and CO<sub>2</sub>.   There are significant differentiation among strains which result in different fermentation characteristics and flavors.  The remaining yeast strains cover many different genera and have widely different effect on wort.  It also contains some other well known yeasts such as Brettanomyces, wich is commonly used for the *farmhouse funk* flavor it can impart on the beer.

### Bacteria
Bacteria are generally split into two groups gram-negative and gram-positive. This designation is based on their reaction to crystal violet dye.  The staining technique, developed in 1884 by [Hans Christian Gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Gram), is quick and simple way to identify the presence of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of these bacteria.  This differentiation is helpful in organizing and classifying different bacteria.  

#### Gram-positive Bacteria
Two common gram-positive bacteria present in some styles of beer are Lactobacillus and Pediococcus.  These bugs both produce lactic acid as opposed to a yeast's production of ethanol.  This leads to the lowering of the beer's pH. This mechanism of action is sought after in sour beer styles.  In the [sour mash and sour worting techniques](http://byo.com/light-ale/item/889-how-to-make-a-sour-mash-techniques), it is common to use malted grain as a source of Lactobacillus delbruckii.  Care must be taken to create an environment that is favorable to L. delbruckii and hostile to other microbes.  

Pediococcus is another beer spoiling microbe that, when controlled and introduced intentionally, can provide an interesting final beer.  Pediococcus strains also generate lactic acid and, like lactobacillus, can form a [pellicle](http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Pellicle) on the top of a beer.  A significant impact that Pediococcus can impart on a beer is a described "ropiness" or slick mouthfeel.  To offset this, intentionally inoculated beers are usually paired with Brettanomyces which is able to break the offending exopolysaccharides.  

The remaining gram-positive bacteria are generally seen as beer spoiling contaminants.  Many of these bacterium are pellicle forming and may not reach a taste or observation threshold until after packaging.  

#### Gram-negative Bacteria
The Gram-negative grouping of bacteria encompass the remaining commonly found bacteria.  They have widely different effects on finished beer.   

Enterobacteriaceae are a wide grouping of gram-negative bacteria.  Generally speaking, these microbes are alcohol and pH sensitive.  An infection of one these bacterium typically occurs prior to the completion of fermentation.  The commonly described off flavors caused by this group is *baby dipers* and *barnyard*.  Some Enteric bacteria can produce dimethyl sulfide and diacetyl beer spoiling compounds.

Another commonly found group of gram-negative bacteria are the microbes that produce acetic acid.  The most notable, Acetobacter, is commonly used to produce vinegar.   Acetobacter, and the lesser known Gluconobacter, are widely present in the environment and convert ethanol into acetic acid.  While not often a issue in properly packaged beer, it is quite common in dirty or improperly cleaned draft equipment and taps.


## Going Forward
Now that we have a basic understanding of what microbial contaminants are common in the brewing environment, we can continue on to understanding what products and systems can keep these microbes at bay.  [Head on over to Part 3](#)
