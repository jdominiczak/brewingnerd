Brewing, in an overly simplistic sense, is the creation of growth media for the single celled organism of choice.  It just so happens that we have developed a taste for the resulting waste liquid.  Our goal as brewers is to control the living organisms that are present in our beer to only the ones we want.  Understanding what common contaminants are, where they come from, and what issues they present assist the brewer in developing a system that limits the probability of contamination and infection.

## Microbial contaminants
The microbial contaminants we cover here fall into three broad categories: yeasts, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria.  While it may be counterintuitive that yeast is included as a category, wild or unintended yeasts that make their way into the wort can affect the final product.  The same goes for bacteria.  Many styles of beer rely on bacteria to provide it's signature taste or mouthfeel.  While in these styles the aforementioned microbes are not contaminants, if they are unintentionally present in a beer it is considered a flaw.  

### Yeasts
The single celled eukaryotes known as yeasts are nearly omnipresent in the environment.  While the term yeast is often used to describe either brewing or baking yeast strains, there exist a plethora of non-brewing strains.  The Saccharomyces genus contains the top cropping (*S. cerevisiae*) and bottom cropping (*S. pastorianus*) strains of brewers yeast.   There are significant differentiation among strains which result in different fermentation characteristics and flavors.  The remaining yeast strains cover many different genera and have widely different effect on wort.  It also contains some other well known yeasts such as Brettanomyces, wich is commonly used for it's *farmhouse funk* flavors it imparts on the beer.

### Bacteria
Bacteria are generally split into two groups gram-negative and gram-positive. This designation is based on their reaction to
