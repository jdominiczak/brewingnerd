Cleaning is the process used to remove foreign matter from a surface.  On the pro-brewer scale, this is usually accomplished largely by using clean in place (CIP) techniques.  High pressure streams of acid and caustic washes provide an automated solution for many large vessels.  The remainder is usually cleaned <em>out of place</em> with some elbow grease. On the homebrew scale, there are just too many requirements to effectively operate a CIP system.  Maintaining a sanitary environment is a wholly separate process and system.  While a sanitary environment requires proper cleaning, it also goes beyond that.  It includes such aspects as preventing grain dust floating in the air, the use of aseptic techniques, and keeping pests at bay.  

## Cleaning Agents

##### Warm Water and Mechanical Cleaning
While this may seem like a given, using warm water and a good brush or pad will clean out an astonishing amount of dirt and grime on brewing surfaces.  By cleaning off surfaces as you brew, the dirt and grime doesn't have time to harden up.  With a bit of scrubbing, most foreign matter can be cleaned out.

##### Household Detergent
Standard household dish detergent does its job in the homebrew environment.  The surfactant in detergent works well when dealing with oily and organic matter.  Try to seek out a fragrant and dye free brand and rinse well following cleaning.

##### Sodium Percarbonate (Oxiclean)
Sodium Percarbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>â€¢3 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is the active ingredient in number of commercial cleaners such as OxiClean and OxiBoost.  This oxidizing cleanser is commonly used on homebrewing equipment.  It is commonly used to remove the adhesive left on recycled beer bottles.  A few hour soak in a warm OxiClean bath makes short work of the gummy residue.  A good rinse with hot water following cleaning is necessary to remove any remaining cleanser. Seek out the fragrant and dye free versions (i.e. OxiClean Free).

##### P.B.W.
Powdered Brewery Wash (P.B.W.) is a buffered alkaline detergent combination of Sodium Metasillicate (Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>) and Sodium Percarbonate.  Due to the Sodium Metasillicate, it has increased buffering abilities in hard-water environments.  PBW is used in the same manner as Oxiclean.  

##### Tri-Sodium Phosphate (TSP)
You're unlikely to see much of true TSP on the shelves anymore.  Just a few short years ago it was ubiquitous in cleaning products but its use was [wreaking havoc on lakes and rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication).  Many of the TSP branded cleaners no longer have any actual TSP in them anymore.  Lets not screw up our lakes and rivers any more than we already have, there are other options.

##### Bar Keeper's Friend
The 134 year old cleaning product, Bar Keeper's Friend, is well known for cleaning stainless steel.  It's active ingredient, Oxalic acid (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) works well to remove rust, burnt on grime, and beer stone.  

## Sanitizing Agents

##### Bleach
The old standby; Bleach. Regular old household bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite - NaClO) has been used for millennia.   A solution of 1 tablespoon per gallon is an effective sanitizing agent given 20 minutes of contact time.  A complete rinse is required.  It can also be used as a cleaning agent.  For those who don't use bleach often, a reminder:  Do not mix bleach with ammonia based cleaners.  This will produce Nitrogen Trichloride (NCl<sub>3</sub>), a compound that causes severe lung injury.   Don't leave the bleach solution in contact with metals for a extended period of time as the solution will cause corrosion.

##### Iodine (Iodophor)
The most popular Iodine based sanitizer, Iodophor, is widely used in the food industry.  At the manufacturer recommended concentration, the solution sanitizes in ten minutes.  While there is some anecdotal evidence for the contact time being as little as one minute, ten minutes is still recommended by the manufacturer.  While it is quite effective as a sanitizer, it will not function as a cleanser.  All surfaces must be free of any foreign matter.  Iodophor is a no-rinse sanitizer, but be forewarned, it will stain plastics.  The resulting brown hue is just cosmetic.  Homebrewers with an iodine allergy should avoid Iodophor and choose an alternative.
  
##### Star San
Star San is possibly the most popular no-rinse sanitizer in homebrewing.  One ounce of the Star San concentrate diluted in 5 gallons of water will produce a solution where the active ingredient, Dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>29</sub>NaO<sub>3</sub>S), will have a 300ppm concentration.  The contact time of Star San is 1 to 2 minutes and the sanitizing solution can be sprayed on, or the surface can be submerged in the solution.  The manufacturer specifically states to not rinse the surface following application of star san.  You can keep a bucket of Star San around between brew days as long as the pH remains below 3 (pH test strips are handy for this).  Use of RO or distilled water will lengthen the time a batch will last.  Star San, when agitated, produces a large volume of fluffy foam.  This foam will sanitize the surface it's touching.  Don't fear the foam.

##### A word of caution
There are still a few homebrew kits and old Geocities websites saying that some cleansers on the market (c-brite, one-step) are sanitizers.  While these cleansers have some sanitizing action due to their peroxide generation, their efficacy is either unproven or poor.  It's best to use these as cleansers and then use a true sanitizing agent.
